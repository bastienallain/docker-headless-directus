# PostgreSQL 17.5 Production Configuration for Directus
# Based on performance tuning documentation

# =================================
# MEMORY CONFIGURATION
# =================================

# shared_buffers: 25-40% of RAM (assuming 8GB system = 2-3GB)
shared_buffers = 2GB

# work_mem: Per connection memory for sorting/hash tables
# Formula: (Total RAM - shared_buffers) / max_connections
# (8GB - 2GB) / 300 = ~20MB

# maintenance_work_mem: For VACUUM, CREATE INDEX operations
# PostgreSQL 17 removed 1GB limit - use 5-10% of RAM

# =================================
# CONNECTION AND AUTHENTICATION
# =================================

# max_connections: Production level

# Connection pooling recommended with PgBouncer for higher loads

# =================================
# WAL AND CHECKPOINT CONFIGURATION
# =================================

# Recommendation: 4-10GB for busy systems

# checkpoint_timeout: Target 3-5 minutes for production

# =================================
# QUERY PLANNER CONFIGURATION
# =================================

# =================================
# AUTOVACUUM CONFIGURATION
# =================================

# Enable autovacuum (should be on by default)

# Autovacuum max workers: PostgreSQL 17 can handle more
autovacuum_max_workers = 6

# Scale factor for autovacuum threshold

# =================================
# STATISTICS CONFIGURATION
# =================================

# pg_stat_statements configuration

# =================================
# BACKGROUND WRITER CONFIGURATION
# =================================

# Background writer delay

# Background writer LRU maxpages

# Background writer LRU multiplier
bgwriter_lru_multiplier = 2.0

# =================================
# LOCK MANAGEMENT
# =================================

# Max locks per transaction (for complex Directus operations)
max_locks_per_transaction = 256

# =================================
# POSTGRESQL 17 SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATIONS
# =================================

# Enable improved VACUUM performance (PostgreSQL 17 feature)
# Uses new data structure with 20x less memory usage
vacuum_buffer_usage_limit = 256MB

# Enable streaming I/O interface improvements
# (Automatically enabled in PostgreSQL 17)

# =================================
# DIRECTUS SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATIONS
# =================================
